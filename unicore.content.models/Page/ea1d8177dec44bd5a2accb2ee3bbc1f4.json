  "content": "My baby was born at the hospital and the doctor and the nurse told me that I must only give her breastmilk \u2013 nothing else. Now that I am at home, I feel so confused. My mother-in-law has told me to give honey to my baby every morning. She says it will improve her immunity and make her more resistant to disease. I asked my husband and he says that that I should follow his mother\u2019s advice as she has more experience than me. But I remember the doctor said I must give her nothing but breastmilk until she is 6 months old. What should I do?\r\n\r\n**MAMA Help:** Listen to your doctor. You should give your baby only breastmilk and no other food - not even water or honey. If you can do this until your baby is 6 months you can reduce the risk of infectious diseases like diarrhoea. These diseases can cause malnutrition and stunting.",
