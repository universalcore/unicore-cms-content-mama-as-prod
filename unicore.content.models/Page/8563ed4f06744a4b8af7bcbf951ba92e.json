In labour, you and your baby are at risk of infection. Hospitals prevent infections.\r\n-\tIf you have a difficult labour, or your baby has problems, hospital staff can treat problems promptly.\r\n-\tSome mothers get cash assistance from the government if they give birth in a hospital. If you are over 19 years old and have a BPL card, you can apply for cash assistance. Your doctor can help you to get the right documents.\r\n\r\nWork out how long it will take to get there. Talk with your family about transport and decide who you will have with you. Choose someone you trust.\r\n\r\nIf your baby comes too quickly or you cannot get to a hospital for the birth:\r\n\r\n-\tIt is vital to have a medically skilled attendant or *dai*. Make sure your family knows how to contact the attendant. Your attendant may have a birth kit. It will contain a sheet, gloves, clean string and tools for cutting your baby's cord. \r\n-\tIf you cannot get a birth kit, find a clean sheet to have your baby on and 2 cloths, one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in. Have a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors ready. \r\n-\tYour attendant must wash her hands and you must wash between your legs. Get plenty of clean, safe, boiled water and soap ready.\r\n-\tGo to the health facility as soon as you can after your baby is born\r\n",
