It is best to have at least 4 visits while you are pregnant. Try to make the first visit for just after you missed your period. \r\n\r\nHere is why regular check-ups are important:\r\n\r\n-\tAt the check-up, a health worker will do tests to make sure that you and your baby are well. \r\n-\tIf there are problems when you are pregnant, your doctor will find them early. This will give you the best chance of getting the right treatment so you and your baby are healthy.\r\n-\tIf you have questions about your pregnancy, your health worker is the best person to ask. She will answer your questions and will give you the right information. She might refer you to the doctor if you have questions she cannot answer or if she suspects that something is wrong.\r\n-\tYou can get iron, calcium and folic acid tablets from a government health facility. They may be free. These tablets give you the strength to carry your baby and help your baby to grow well. \r\n-\tYou will feel reassured that your baby is growing well.\r\n\r\nFind out how to get to your nearest clinic. If you need to take a bus, van or rickshaw, start saving for the fare now. Talk to your family about why you need to visit regularly during pregnancy. Ask them for help if you need transport. \r\n\r\nIf you are worried, ask a close friend or a family member to go with you. If it is a long way, you may want to carry some food and water with you.\r\n",
