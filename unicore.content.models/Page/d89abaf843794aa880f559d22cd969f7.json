  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nBeing constipated means you are finding it difficult to pass stools or are not passing them at all. Or you might be unable to fully empty your bowels. Your stools might also be unusually hard, lumpy, large or small.\r\n\r\nLots of women get constipated in pregnancy. It has different causes: \r\n\r\n-\tAs your baby gets bigger, your womb presses down on your pelvic area. This makes constipation more likely.\r\n-\tPregnancy hormones can also slow the movement of food through your body. \r\n-\tA lack of exercise can also slow your digestive system down.\r\n\r\nYou can help your body by eating more fruit and vegetables. Try dark green leafy vegetables like spinach (paalak) and fenugreek (methi), and also eat guava (amrood), taro or colocasia (arbi) and mushrooms (khumbi). Vegetables and fruit are high in fibre, which will help to make your stools softer and easier to pass. Drink plenty of clean, boiled water. This will also help prevent constipation. \r\n\r\nIt is very important to take iron tablets every day. They can cause constipation. Do not stop taking the tablets, as they are very important for you and your baby\u2019s health. Instead, ask your doctor or health worker for a different type of iron tablet and drink more clean, safe water; eat well and make sure you get some exercise every day.\r\n",
