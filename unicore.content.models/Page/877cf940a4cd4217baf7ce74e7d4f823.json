The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n-\tYour breasts look and feel different\r\n-\tYou notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n-\tYou feel nauseous\r\n-\tYou need to pass urine more than usual \r\n-\tYou miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a health worker or doctor. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start to take steps to care for your health so you can grow your new baby. A health worker will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe health worker will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your urine. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a health worker? Ask a friend or family member to go with you.",
