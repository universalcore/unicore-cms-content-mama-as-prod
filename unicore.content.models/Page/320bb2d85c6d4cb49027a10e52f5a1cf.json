This reduces your risk of catching infections. \r\n\r\nHere is how you can make sure you stay clean:\r\n\r\n-\tWash your hands with soap. This is an easy way to stop the germs that cause diarrhoea. Wash your hands when you come home, before cooking and eating, after using the toilet, passing urine or stools, and after dealing with animals. You need clean, safe water and soap. Make sure that you wash your wrists, hands and nails. Wash the soap off your hands with clean, safe water. \r\n-\tEvery time you use the toilet, clean yourself well. Wash yourself from front to back. Wash your hands with soap soon after.\r\n-\tIf you wear underwear, use cotton fabric that lets air to your skin. And drink lots of clean, safe water. This will help prevent infections in your urine.\r\n-\tWash your whole body often. Regular bathing will keep you healthy and less prone to illness.\r\n-\tIf you have a toilet, keep that area clean. Ask each person to throw water to clean the place after they use the toilet.\r\n",
