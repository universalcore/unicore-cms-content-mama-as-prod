Eat rice, roti, pulses (dal), porridge, coconut milk, milk and milk products like buttermilk (chhaach), paneer and curd. If you are non-vegetarian, have eggs, fish and other non-vegetarian food regularly. If possible, add nuts such as almond, walnut, cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like bananas, mangoes, jackfruit and ripe papayas are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food, such as dried chana or nuts, with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n**2.\tGet check-ups** while you are pregnant. Try to have 4 visits to your doctor. Get your blood and urine tests and blood pressure checks done as often as your doctor or health worker advises. These tests help to find problems early.
