They help your baby to grow healthily and keep your body in good shape for becoming a mother. \r\n\r\nEat a variety of fresh food of different colours each day to get vitamins:\r\n\r\n-\tEggs, orange-coloured fruit and vegetables like mangoes and ripe papaya, sweet potato or carrots. These foods contain vitamin A, which helps your baby's organs and body systems to develop.\r\n\r\n-\tBananas, potatoes and chicken, brown rice and green vegetables. These foods supply B vitamins which help your body form new red blood cells and develop your baby\u2019s brain and nerves.\r\n\r\n-\tCitrus fruit like pomelo (*chakotra*), Indian gooseberry (*amla*) and lime, vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes. These are all good sources of vitamin C, which is needed for repairing and growing skin and body tissue. It also helps growth and strengthens bones and teeth. \r\n\r\n-\tOily fish like sardines, soya products, almonds, rice and eggs. These contain vitamin D, which helps to build bones and teeth and helps you to fight germs. Our bodies can also make  vitamin D from sunlight.\r\n\r\nEating the right food is extremely important. But there are some vital vitamins your body needs during pregnancy that are difficult to get enough of just from food. So take the folic acid, iron and calcium tablets that your doctor will prescribe.\r\n",
