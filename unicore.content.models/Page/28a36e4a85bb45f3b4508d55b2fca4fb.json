  "content": "The doctor has confirmed my pregnancy and everyone in the family is excited. But I have started to vomit every morning. My husband leaves for work early in the morning and I am supposed to prepare and pack up his lunch. But now I cannot do this any more. I can\u2019t stand the smell of food and the moment I enter the kitchen I feel like throwing up. It lasts most of the day. For the first few weeks he did not say anything and my mother in law made his lunch, but now they are getting tired of it. He thinks I am using this as an excuse to escape my work. My mother-in-law also commented on it. She said that she has also borne children, but she never compromised on her household duties. I do not know how to handle this. \r\n\r\n**MAMA Help**: Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy. It usually start around the sixth week of pregnancy and stop around the 12th week. In the morning, try eating a few biscuits and rest for 15 minutes before getting up. Get up slowly and do not lie down right after eating. If cooking smells bother you, open windows and turn on the stove fan.",
