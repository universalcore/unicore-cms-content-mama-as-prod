  "content": "My wife is 4 months pregnant and we have not had sex since we found out. I am feeling very alone and want to make love to her. Initially when I would approach her, my wife would say that having sex during pregnancy could harm the baby. She also worries that it will have a bad influence on our baby, or disturb it somehow. Although some of my friends told me that it is alright, I do not want to do anything that will harm my baby.  \r\n\r\n**MAMA Help:** You won't hurt your baby by making love, even with you on top. The thick mucus plug that seals the cervix helps guard against infection. The amniotic sac and the strong muscles of the uterus (womb) also protect your baby. Your wife may notice your baby moves around more. However, this is because of her pounding heart, not because the baby knows what's happening or feels discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe only time it is not good to have sex is if your wife has bleeding, abdominal cramps or pain, or broken waters. Then the doctor may advise you not to have sex.\r\n",
