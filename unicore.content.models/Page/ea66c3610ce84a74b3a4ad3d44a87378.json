Is your skin changing? Are you feeling breathless? Welcome to pregnancy!\r\n\r\n**These are warning signs.** See a doctor if you have any of these feelings:\r\n\r\n-\tPain in your belly\r\n-\tA fever\r\n-\tBlurred vision and you are seeing spots in front of your eyes\r\n-\tFluid leaking from your vagina\r\n-\tPain when passing urine\r\n-\tIf you are past 5 months in your pregnancy, and your baby has stopped kicking or is kicking much less\r\n-\tIf you have heavy bleeding or bleeding with pain.\r\n",
