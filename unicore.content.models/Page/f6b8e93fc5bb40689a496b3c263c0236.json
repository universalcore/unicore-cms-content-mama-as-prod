  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is always best to visit a government hospital where staff are qualified.\r\n\r\nFriends and family might offer herbal remedies or tonics or suggest you go to a local healer. Maybe you used these in the past but now you are pregnant **you need to be very careful** about what you take.\r\n\r\nWhen you are pregnant, and when you are breastfeeding, some remedies and tonics might harm your baby. \r\n\r\nA good rule is to check with your doctor before taking any remedies or medicines. She will be able to tell you which are safe for you and your growing baby.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to remember is not to use pregnancy herbal drinks or syrups. They often contain alcohol, so are not good for you at all! They are bad for you and your baby.",
