  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nEating solid food is a big step!\r\n\r\nYou can tell if your baby is ready to start eating solid food. It is when she is over 6 months old. A baby who is ready to start solids can usually do these things:\r\n\r\n-\tShe holds her head up.\r\n-\t She sits up well when supported. You may have to sit your baby on your lap at first.\r\n-\tShe makes chewing motions. Your baby should be able to move food to the back of her mouth and swallow.\r\n-\tShe is curious about what you are eating. When babies look at your food and stretch their hands out to it, this is a sign that they are ready to eat solid food.\r\n-\tShe is a healthy weight. Most babies are ready to eat soft solids when they have doubled their birth weight. This is usually at about 6 months.\r\n\r\nYour baby may be showing these signs before 6 months. But it is safer if you wait until she is 6 months old before giving her mashed foods. By then her digestive system is stronger. This means there is less chance of her having a stomach problem or a bad reaction to food.\r\n",
